## The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison (Sarah Monette)

1. [The Goblin Emperor](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780765365682/thegoblinemperor)

## The Cemeteries of Amalo by Katherine Addison

The main character in these books was a supporting character in The Goblin
Emperor, but you don't need to read the Goblin Emperor to understand these
books.

A little mystery, a little religion, a little magic, some low-key gay
romance. I really enjoy the pacing of these books; they are quiet and
contemplative in a way that many other books in the genre are not.

## Temple of the White Rat by T. Kingfisher (Ursula Vernon)

A little humor, a little romantasy, enjoyable characters, and good stories.
The series listed here can all be read independently -- they are set in the
same world, but don't depend on each other.
